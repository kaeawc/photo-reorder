# photo-reorder

Experiments with RecyclerView Drag &amp; Drop

This is an attempt to show how Photo reordering might be implemented, either with existing libraries or bare-bones Android components. This project is going to start by building off a few known libraries (AdvancedRecyclerView, RecyclerViewHelper, DynamicGrid) first and delve into lower level compontents later.

# Example:
